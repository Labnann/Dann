#Description

Dannjs is a simple Deep Neural Network library. You can create any DNN with X number of layers.
This is the client version of the library, thus, it is dependent on p5js. If you want to have the backend version you can download it with npm.(npm install dannjs)

Dannjs is not at its final version, it is still in development.
