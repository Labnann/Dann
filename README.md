What it does:
------------
Create Neural Networks In a few lines of code.
Dannjs allows for the creation of neural network js objects for web applications aswell as nodejs. You can save & load weights.

Usage (simplified):
------------
1. Create the Dann Object (neural network), specify the number of input neurons and the number of output neurons.
2. Add the hidden layers. To add a hidden layer, you have to specify the neuron count and the activation function.
3. Change some other settings (learning rate, loss function) & .log(); the model to display information.
4. Feed/train the model with some data!
