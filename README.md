What it does:
------------
Dannjs allows you to create any Deep Neural Network and train it with a dataset. 

How it works:
------------
1. Create the Dann Object (neural network), specify the number of input neurons and the number of output neurons.
2. Add the hidden layers. To add a hidden layer, you have to specify the neuron count and the activation function.
3. Change some other settings (learning rate, loss function) & .log(); the model to display information.
4. Feed/train the model with some data!

Python version:
------------------
https://github.com/matiasvlevi/Dannpy


Note:
----------
This is the client version of the library, thus, it is dependent on p5js. 
The client version adds graphs to track how the model is doing. (Documentation is coming)
If you want to have the backend version you can download it with npm. 
`npm i dannjs`

Dannjs is not at its final version, it is still in development.
