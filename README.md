What it does:
------------
Dannjs allows for the creation of Neural Network JS objects for Web Applications & Nodejs. Dannjs allows you to train a neural network in multiple ways, you can either use mutations (Neuroevolution tasks) or backpropagation. You can then save & load weights, this allows you to use one model as interpreter of pre trained weights rather than a trainer.
